		<p class="{#prefixSupport#}note">
			We do have scripts of which automatically log errors in the site to our database. Along with the status code we include the current users ip address, an ip address is simply a string of bytes which identifies your computer on the internet. This ip address is logged so that we can identify maliciour attempts to exploit or manipulate errors. Although the prior goal of these logs is to raise my attention to bugs it must contain the ip address in order to maintain the security of the website and the users associated.
